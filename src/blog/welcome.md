# 👋 Welcome to OS25!

Welcome to my portfolio — a fully interactive, linux themed operating system built for exploration, education, and a bit of fun.

This project is part of my journey as a cybersecurity professional and full-stack developer. I’ve designed it to feel like a custom Linux OS:
- 🖥️ Launch terminal simulations
- 📂 Navigate a fake file system
- 📝 Read `.txt` and `.md` files
- 📖 View blog posts like this one!

---

## 💡 What You'll Find Here

- **Tools & Projects:** React, Supabase, Tailwind, Linux emulation, and more
- **Writeups & Tips:** Notes from hacking competitions, blue team work, and secure coding

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Click the **Start menu**, launch the **Terminal**, or explore the **Files** directory. Try opening any `.txt` or `.md` files to see what’s inside.

More content is coming soon — this is just the beginning.

Thanks for visiting!
